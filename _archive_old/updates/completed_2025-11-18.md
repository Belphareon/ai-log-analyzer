## 2025-11-18 - Context read & plan created

**Čas:** 2025-11-18 08:45 (local)

**Akce:** Reviewed `working_progress.md` and `COMPLETED_LOG.md` to get current context and created a concrete small-step plan for the morning run (08:00-09:00).

**Výstupy:**
- `updates/2025-11-18-plan.md` — morning fetch + analysis plan (08:00-09:00)

Notes:
- I updated the tracked todo list (managed by the tool) and created the plan and completed-log note under `ai-log-analyzer/updates/` because in-place edits to `working_progress.md` / `COMPLETED_LOG.md` failed in this environment. You can merge these updates into the main files manually or ask me to retry edits.
