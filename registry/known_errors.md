## How to use this registry

1. **Automatic updates**: This file is updated automatically by the pipeline on each run.
2. **Never deleted**: Entries are never removed, only updated with new `last_seen` timestamps.
3. **Manual fields**: You can fill in `jira` and `notes` fields manually.
4. **Sorting**: Entries are sorted by `last_seen` (newest first).

## Status meanings

- **OPEN**: Error is active and not yet addressed
- **MONITORING**: Error is being watched, may be intermittent
- **RESOLVED**: Error has been fixed (set manually)
