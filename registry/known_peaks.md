## How to use this registry

1. **Automatic updates**: This file is updated automatically by the pipeline on each run.
2. **Never deleted**: Entries are never removed, only updated with new `last_seen` timestamps.
3. **Manual fields**: You can fill in `jira` and `notes` fields manually.
4. **Sorting**: Entries are sorted by `last_seen` (newest first).

## Peak types

- **TRAFFIC_SPIKE**: Abnormal increase in traffic/requests
- **ERROR_BURST**: Sudden burst of errors
- **ANOMALY**: Statistical anomaly detected
